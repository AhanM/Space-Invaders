<p>Space Invaders is a fairly popular arcade game that was first released in 1987. Space Invaders is one of the earliest shooting games and the aim is to defeat waves of aliens with a laser cannon to earn as many points as possible. It was one of the forerunners of modern video gaming and helped expand the video game industry from a novelty to a global industry. Space-Invaders is a modified version of the original.</p>

<p>In the game the player is required to shoot aliens and maneuver around alien lasers simultaneously. There are no levels in the current version but the alien spawn after a constant time interval and eventually try and creep closer to the player's ship. As the game progresses if the player is unable to be accurate with the lasers the player might find himself/herself quite easily surrounded. It takes three lasers to kill the alien ships and it also takes the alien three lasers to kill the player ship. However if the alien ships collide with the player ship it is immediately game over.</p>

<p>The game is made using Python 2.7.10 and Pygame. These must be installed in order to run the game. The software doesn't require significant processing power due to the simple engine used in the game. The game should run quite smoothly on most computers.  </p>

<a id="future-versions" class="anchor" href="#future-versions" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Future Versions</h3>

<p>The game is still in its beta stage and various features such as different game modes, power ups and levels are yet to be added but are being worked upon. However version v2.0 will most likely incorporate these and might even allow player vs player and two player co-op. It is set to be released in mid-2016. </p>

<p>The game was made by Ahan Mukhopadhyay(<a href="https://github.com/XxGhostxX">@XxGhostxX</a>) in August 2015. It was inspired by the success the of the original Space Invaders and the fact that it has unfortunately lost popularity eventhough paradoxically in pop culture the pixelated enemy alien is often used as a synecdoche representing video games as a whole. This is one of the first games he had made.  </p>
